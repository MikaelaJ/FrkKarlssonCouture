        <p>
          I was born in Stockholm, Sweden and early got an interest of clothes and tailoring. The BBC series The house of Elliot made me choose my education to become a tailor. I love my work and always try to continue to educate myself in different ways. I seek to develope my thechnics and skills. Im very eager to keep the tailoring alive and bring it in to the future, and I am doing it for exaple by beeing the Chairwoman of the board for Stockholms Skrädderiidkareföreing, an assosiation for tailors in Stockholm, and as a Director in the commite of World Federation of Master Tailors.
          Occationally I teach at Tillskärarakademin in Stockholm, the school of tailoring and cutting.
